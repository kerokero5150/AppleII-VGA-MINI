# A][ VGA MINI Card
My board concept is to provide inexpensive graphics cards to enthusiasts, don't making their own, so I use a lot of SMD parts that people who like soldering their own don't like. We have prepared two types: Purple and Black.
PCBs smaller than 100x100mm can often be made cheaply, so I tried configuring a small board with SMD parts. We are proud that it has excellent cost performance and has a cool and luxurious feel. It's still in the prototyping stage.<BR><BR>

- Small size within 100x100mm<BR>
- Uses cheap SMD parts, they are as large as possible, by maximizing the 1.27 pitch, solder defects are less likely to occur at the factory.<BR>
- Short size db15 connectors can be used.<BR>
- Used clone Pi Pico boards, black and purple they look good.<BR>
- Equipped with a 3.3V regulator that generates less heat.

## For other information

We have GERBER to make these two types of PCBs, but the pin out of the pico board is different for each, so we are still preparing. However, if you are making your own, I think another fork of [Briel's version](https://github.com/retrotink/Apple-II-VGA) is easier to assemble. We refer to his version for the circuit configuration of the buffer transceivers.<BR><BR>

It will be sold in our store. *Early February 2024<BR>
