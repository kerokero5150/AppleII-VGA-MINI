# A][ VGA MINI Card
My board concept is to provide inexpensive graphics cards to enthusiasts, don't making their own, so I use a lot of SMD parts that people who like soldering their own don't like. We have prepared two types: Purple and Black.
Although we named it "mini", it's actually not extremely small, but since PSB companies can make it cheaply within 100x100mm, I made it small accordingly. We are proud that it has excellent cost performance and has a cool and luxurious feel. Purple card is still in the prototyping stage.<BR><BR>

- Small size within 100x100mm<BR>
- Uses cheap SMD parts, they are as large as possible, by maximizing the 1.27 pitch ICs, solder defects are less likely to occur at the factory.<BR>
- Short size db15 connectors can be used.<BR>
- Used clone Pi Pico boards, black and purple they look good.<BR>
- Equipped with a 3.3V regulator that generates less heat.<BR>
- Fun artwork by Drake.

## For other information

### Gerber and soldering work

We have [Gerber](Gerber_GH) to make this card, Raspberry Pi Pico board matches with genuine pinouts.ã€€[Here](A2VGA_BLK_BOM.xlsx) is BOM. Gerber's silkscreen has been modified. This is because the artwork is copyrighted by Drake. Furthermore, since we are not only amateur developers but also have to run our own store, we have a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. You can create it for free if you want to use it.<BR><BR>
If SMD soldering is difficult your own, we think another fork of [Briel's version](https://github.com/retrotink/Apple-II-VGA) is easier to assemble. We refering to their version for the circuit configuration of the buffer transceivers.<BR><BR>

### install the firmeware

This project is fork version of markadev's AppleII VGA, You can set it up by following the article [here](https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA/tree/main/pico).<BR><BR>Of course, you can use the .uf2 files published by the designers of these forks, including Briel... as they are.<BR>
